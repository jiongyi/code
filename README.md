# README

I'm a postdoctoral scholar in the [Mullins lab](http://mullinslab.ucsf.edu/) at UCSF. This repository contains code---mostly in MATLAB---that I've written over the past few years for several projects. Over the next few months, I'll try to organize the folders a bit better and organize the code.
